    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Founded by University of Washington audio AI signal processing Professor Les Atlas (CTO), Virutec is a Washington-based company pioneering AI algorithms that identify various respiratory diseases through smartphone-recorded forced coughing sounds.</p>

    <p>We're shaping the future of diagnostics and disease surveillance. Our mission is to diagnose diseases like COVID-19, TB, flu, and RSV from the sound of coughs and voices, and we're building a respiratory disease spread forecast system. This system uses cough surveillance testing across groups of people to rapidly track and predict the emergence of both known and unknown pathogens.</p>

    <p>Our innovations have garnered a patent jointly owned with the University of Washington. We're proud to have been part of the MIT Sandbox Program and the LSWI WIN mentoring program, and we're actively involved in the WTIA Founders Program. Our primary customer base includes airlines, the transportation industry, public health departments, and medical/life insurers.</p>
