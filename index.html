    <h2>About Us</h2>
    <p>Founded by University of Washington professor Dr. Les Atlas and UC Berkeley alumni Amil Khanzada, Virutec is a Washington-based research organization pioneering AI algorithms that identify various respiratory diseases through smartphone-recorded forced coughing sounds. Our team boasts 60 partner organizations and 250 volunteers, including faculty and alumni from distinguished institutions like Stanford, Harvard, Berkeley, CMU, UChicago, UW, and MIT.</p>

    <p>We're shaping the future of diagnostics and disease surveillance. Our mission is to diagnose diseases like COVID-19, TB, flu, and RSV from the sound of coughs and voices, and we're building a respiratory disease spread forecast system. This system uses cough surveillance testing across groups of people to rapidly track and predict the emergence of both known and unknown pathogens.</p>

    <p>Our innovations have garnered a patent jointly owned with the University of Washington. We're proud to have been part of the MIT Sandbox Program and Seattle LSWI, and we're actively involved in the WTIA Founders Program. Our primary customer base includes airlines,
